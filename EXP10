Experiment No 10: Binary Search Method

Aim: Implementation of Binary Search Method.
Objectives :
1) Understand how to implement Binary Search algorithm.
Theory :
The improvement to searching method to reduce the amount of work can be done
using binary searching. Binary searching is more efficient than linear searching if an array to
be searched is in sorted manner.
Here an key item to be searched is compared with the item at middle of array. If they
are equal search is completed. If the middle element is greater than key item searching
proceeds with left sub array. Similarly, if middle element is less than key item than searching
proceeds with right sub array and so on till the element is found.
For large arrays, this method is superior to sequential searching.
Algorithm :
FIND(arr, x, first, last)
if (first &gt; last)then
return -1
End if
mid = (first + last) / 2
if (arr[mid] = x)
return mid
